# Surgeon Attention Drift Detection (Ongoing Research)

### A Deep Learning Project by [Your Name]

This repository presents my ongoing work on a **real-time AI system** that detects **surgeon attention drifts** during surgical procedures and **learns the surgeon’s operating patterns** simultaneously.  
The goal is to build a model that **adapts to individual surgeons**, predicting when their focus might lapse and learning from their unique surgical behavior — ultimately paving the way toward safer, smarter surgical assistance systems.

## 🧩 Project Overview

Modern surgeries demand extreme precision, yet even expert surgeons experience momentary attention drifts due to fatigue, stress, or multitasking.  
This model is designed to **analyze real-time video and motion data** to:
- Detect when a surgeon’s focus drifts.  
- Predict potential lapses **before they occur**.  
- Learn **each surgeon’s unique operating style** to personalize feedback.  

It is built using **PyTorch** and trained on the **MVOR (Multi-View Operating Room)** dataset — a benchmark dataset for human activity recognition in surgical environments.

## 🧠 Model Concept

The core architecture blends **temporal attention mechanisms** and **spatio-temporal feature extraction**.  
The system continuously updates its understanding of the surgeon’s visual and physical behavior, using that feedback to:
- Identify deviations from the surgeon’s normal attention patterns.  
- Improve prediction accuracy with every iteration.  
- Support real-time monitoring and potential integration into robotic surgical assistants.

## 🧪 Current Progress

- ✅ Data preprocessing and model setup in PyTorch.  
- ✅ Initial attention drift detection trained on MVOR.  
- 🚧 Real-time prediction and adaptive learning in progress.  
- 🚧 Validation on custom testing scenarios upcoming.

This is an **in-progress research project**, but I’m sharing it now to reflect my growth, learning process, and commitment to pushing forward — no matter the obstacles.

## 🎓 Personal Note

This project represents more than code.  
It’s a reflection of how deeply I want to **understand intelligence itself** — not just in machines, but in how humans think, focus, and learn.  

I built this as part of my personal journey toward becoming an AI researcher who contributes something meaningful to the world — and I’m **determined to keep improving it**, step by step.

My dream is to study at **Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI)** — where innovation meets purpose.  
I might not have all the answers yet, but I’m proving every day that I’m willing to work harder than anyone to find them.
